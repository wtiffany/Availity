# 1. Tell me about your proudest professional achievement.  It can be a personal or school project.

In my current position I designed and implemented an internal team management chat application. Prior to joining this company, there was no defined technology stack in place and I was given a chance to solely architect and design this project that would be used by every employee of the company. After researching and comparing different technologies, I chose to work with React because I like how clean the code is when it is broken down into modular components. C# and SQL Server were used because of interoperability with the existing technologies used at the company. I chose to work with the SignalR library because it allows server code to send asynchronous notifications to the client-side web application. This program is also used to track key performance indicators like a salesperson’s current and past sales.
My proudest professional achievement was when I launched this application company-wide and was met with positive responses by end users. I was the sole developer from design to implementation and was told by the CEO that I had elevated the company’s software development environment by replacing their outdated technologies with modern technologies that could deliver the requirements of modern processes.


# 2. Tell me about a book, blog, article or GitHub repo you read or liked recently, and why you like it and why you should recommend I do the same.

I recently came across an article called “The S.O.L.I.D Principles in Pictures” by Ugonna Thelma that illustrates the five software development principles to follow when building software so that it is easier to scale and maintain. When I was first introduced to Object Oriented Programming and S.O.L.I.D principles years ago, I found them difficult to understand as I was unable to find many resources that could illustrate them in a relatable or meaningful way. However, when I read this particular article, I wished I could have read this years ago as it creatively and clearly explains these programming principles with images. For anyone who is new to programming, I would highly recommend this article.


# 3. If you were to describe to a 7-year old what Availity does, what would you say?

When someone gets sick they usually go to a doctor to get better, but going to see the doctor can cost a lot of money. So some people like to buy something called a health plan that helps them pay for the doctor’s visit. For them to get better, the doctor and the health plan need to work together as a team
but, sometimes the doctor and the health plan do not work together and act like they are on separate teams. What Availity does is bring the doctor and the health plan together by making sure both the health plan and doctor can quickly get all of the important information so that way they can get to see the doctor even faster.
